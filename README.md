# Portfolio Template 
This project is for a portfolio site that can be updated from an admin pannel for "ease of use" but mostly so I can prove that I know how to make a website...kinda.   
  
The site/application is split into two different parts The admin pannel and then the main page.  
The admin pannel allows a user to add/edit/delete parts of their portfolio without having to go through the code for the website.
